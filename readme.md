Lightweight CSS

I teach aspiring developers the fundamentals of programming using the web and JavaScript. I use the web deliberately, because it provides immediate feedback and visible rewards as they write code and see results. That feedback loop keeps people engaged and makes abstract concepts concrete.

This is very different from how I learned programming with C++, where most of the work lived in the terminal and progress was harder to see. The web lowers the entry cost, shortens the feedback cycle, and gives learners something tangible to build toward while they are still developing core programming instincts.

This project supports this approach with tooling. I am building Lightweight CSS library to create web development exercises that are easy to follow and visually consistent.

Once an MVP exists, I want to go further and design a classless, lightweight CSS library for absolute beginners, including children in the five to eight age range. At that level, friction matters even more. Removing classes reduces cognitive load. A learner should be able to write simple HTML and immediately get something that looks intentional and friendly.

In this library and roadmap:

- [x] Establish B&W color system.
- [x] M3 token logic (Variables).
- [ ] Responsive, fixed-width container
- [x] Forms
- [x] Buttons
- [ ] Forms validation
- [ ] Cards
- [ ] Navbar
- [ ] Pagination
- [ ] Toasts
- [ ] Playful typography
